        <h2>ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>like some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake">snakes</a>, they are obligate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_predation">ovivores</a></li>
            <li>they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglofauna">subtroglophiles</a> that carry out all their activities (except egg-hunting) in caves</li>
            <li>they have a reduced metabolism, eating excessively in times of abundance</li>
            <li>
                many tribes exist in many different caves, distinct in culture and coloration
                <ul>
                    <li>however, the Cerulean constitute by far the largest tribe</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>they are typically around 8-10ft tall (without tail)</li>
            <li>they are non-venomous but can still be milked</li>
            <li>have this be a long-term drawing/writing project</li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Yandere Club</summary>
    
        <p>Fuuka Kirishima (霧島風花), blue schoolgirl, very popular and attractive</p>

        <div style="padding-left: 1em;">
            <p>Yandere is a term used to describe a character who is extremely possessive and violent towards their love interest. While often initially sweet and innocent, their love can make them sick and lead to extreme, violent, or psychotic behavior.</p>
            <p>"if you leave me, I'll kill you" ok, I won't do that then, can you pamper me now</p>
            <p>"Come on, why won't you just go out with me?! I love you and have an amazing body (if you ignore my belly)!"</p>
        </div>

        <p>Your adoptive mother (Inori 祈り), who is calm and composed but also a little stern, told you you should join the baking club at your school (since you two like cakes so much and she's getting tired of always being the one to bake it).</p>

        <div style="padding-left: 1em;">
            <p>"Mmm, mmm this cake is good," she muttered as she shimmied off another bite with her fork.</p>
            <p>"So, how's school?" she asked nonchalantly. At your response she uncharacteristically perked up, "<i>really!</i> A girl? That was fast."</p>
            <p>"I'll talk to you later, I'm tired," she said, pushing herself up from her chair. "See you later, mom," you said, to which she added only "yup," before carrying away her big bulky body. You could hear through the hall the floorboards creak with her weight, her bedroom door open, and her bed crunch as she lowered on top of it. It's 4PM.</p>
