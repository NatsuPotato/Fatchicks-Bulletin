    <h1>Quark</h1>
    <p>Low level, memory safe C alternative. You want to manage raw binary? We got you covered.</p>

    <p>The new "bytes" type stores its start and end position in memory, preventing you from performing IO outside of allocated space. Additionally, it stores a "cursor" pointing towards the beginning of its memory. When you index it, you shift this cursor over by the indexed number of bytes.</p>
    
    <pre>
        
bytes data = allocate 1024b;
data[0] = "cats";
data[sizeof "cats"] = " and dogs";

print("%s", data); // "cats and dogs"
    </pre>

    <pre>

bytes data = allocate 1024b;
bytes portion = data[5 int];

// all three of these assignments have the same result
data[sizeof int * 5] = 20;
data[5 int] = 20;
portion[0] = 20;
    </pre>
